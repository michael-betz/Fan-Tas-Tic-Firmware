# Fan-Tas-Tic-Controller
Controller for Pinball machines based on an TM4C123G LaunchPadâ„¢ Evaluation Kit, compatible with the `Mission Pinball` API.

## Hardware features
 * 8x8 Switch matrix inputs
 * 12 onboard drivers for solenoids, 4 of them can do hardware PWM (> 100 kHz)
 * 4 x I2C channels for extension boards
 * 2 x SPI channels for running [WS2811 / WS2812 LED strings](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xled+strand+ws2811.TRS5&_nkw=led+strand+ws2811&_sacat=0)
 * In- / Outputs can be easily and cheaply added with [PCF8574](http://www.ti.com/product/pcf8574) I2C GPIO extenders (check eBay for [cheap I/O modules](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&_nkw=i2c+expander&_frs=1))
 * Super fast USB virtual serial connection to host PC
 * KiCad PCB files available (soon), no tiny SMD components, can be easily assembled by hand

## Software features 
 * Software can handle up to 320 In- / Outputs
 * All Outputs support 4 bit PWM with > 125 Hz (using [binary code modulation](http://www.batsocks.co.uk/readme/art_bcm_1.htm))
 * All inputs are debounced and read 333 times per second
 * Software easily extendable by running [FreeRTOS](http://www.freertos.org/)




# Digital inputs / outputs

To use an PC8574 as input we have to write a 0xFF to it (to prevent the open drain output pulling it low). 
Otherwise outputs and inputs can be processed the same.

Reading an output switch will readback its logical value. So all I2C extenders can be read in bulk
I2C is fast eough to read all of them with 625 Hz repetition rate (the ones not connected will report 0xFF)

Writing a 0 to an input switch will disable the readback and should be avoided
Only write to the I2C addresses which have been specified as outputs!

# The taskDebouncer() 
 It is a debounce routine running with 333 Hz, reading all switches (matrix and I2C) into an array
 * Switch Matrix (SM) is read in foreground
 * I2C transactions happen in background (TI I2C driver), query all port extenders (in parallel to reading the SM)
 * When both reads are finished, continue to Debouncing routine
 * look at t-n history of switch state: (n is stored for each switch in a 2 bit vertical counter)
 * if counter overflows: no change for 4 read cycles = definite change. Store new bit state and bits which changed.
 * The serial reporter function looks for changeg bits, encodes them and reports them on the serial port
 * The quick-fire rule function checks a list of rules, which can be triggered by changed bits, which can lead to immediate actions, like coils firing.

# WS2811 RGB LED strings
Raw data values are attached to serial command and just sent on one of the channels over the SPI hardware

# I2C
There must be commands to do send / receive of custom bytes to custom addresses. Mutex of I2C hardware!

## `hwIndex` identify a input / output port
We use a 16 bit number to identify each input / output pin. 

         Switch input hwIndex addresses:
        ---------------------------------
         0 - 63  --> Switch matrix on mainboard
         64 - 71 --> Solenoid driver on mainboard     (not an input!)
         72 - 79 --> I2Cch. 0, I2Cadr. 0x41, bit 0-7  (First  external PCL GPIO extender on channel 0)
         80 - 87 --> I2Cch. 0, I2Cadr. 0x42, bit 0-7  (Second external PCL GPIO extender on channel 0)
         312-319 --> I2Cch. 3, I2Cadr. 0x47, bit 0-7  (7th    external PCL GPIO extender on channel 3)

### Calculating the hwIndex for the Switch matrix
        hwIndex = SMrow * 8 + SMcol
where SMrow is the row wire number (from 0-7) and SMcol is the column wire number (from 0-7).

### Calculating the hwIndex for I2C inputs
        hwIndex = 64 + I2Cchannel * 64 + ( I2Cadr - 64 ) * 8 + PinIndex
 where I2Cchannel is the output channel on the mainboard (from 0-3), I2Cadr is the configured I2C address
 set by dip switches on the port extender (0x40 - 0x47) and PinIndex is the output pin (0-7).
 
 Output extension boards (solenoid driver / digital outputs / etc.) also use the PCF I2C chip and hence the same
 addresses. The chip knows it is an output one it receives a I2C `write` command. So outputs do not need to be
 configured, just fire the OUT command with the known output address.
 
 Note that hwIndex 0 - 63 is not a valid output address as it refers to the Switch matrix which can never be an output.
 That beeing said, I might map hwIndex 60 - 63 to the internal hardware PWM outputs on the mainboard, which do not
 use the PCF GPIO extenders. To be seen.

## `OUT` Set a solenoid driver output

 * pulse time [ms]
 * pulse power [pwm units]
 * hold power [pwm units]
 
## `RUL` setup a quick-fire rule

 * quickRuleId (0-64)
 * input switch ID number
 * driver output ID number
 * post trigger hold-off time [ms]
 * pulse duration [ms]
 * pulse pwm (0-15)
 * hold pwm  (0-15)
 * Enable trigger on pos edge?
 * Enable auto. output off once input releases
 * Enable level Trigger (no edge check)

### Notes

When enabling level trigger, the edge detecion is disabled and the rule will stay in triggered state
as long as the input is high (or low)
 
When auto. output off is enabled, the rule stays in triggered state as long as the level is high. When the level is low again, it disables the outputs and arms the trigger again.

Warning: When auto. output off is disabled and level trigger is enabled it leads to a periodic trigger condition. Sending trigger events every `triggerHoldOffTime` as long as the level is there (not so good)


### Example command
    RUL 0 0x23 0x100 4 1 15 3 1 1 0
Setup ruleId 0. Input hwIndex is 0x23, output hwIndex is 0x100. After triggering, at least 4 ms need to ellapse before the trigger becomes armed again. Once triggered it pulses the output for 1 ms with pwmPower 15, then it holds the output with pwmPower 3. The trigger happens on a positive edge. Once the input is released (and at least 4 ms ellapsed), the output is switched off again.
