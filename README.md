# Digital inputs / outputs

We have 4 I2C channels where we can connect 8 x PC8574 each. The addresses of the chips need to be configured from 0x40 - 0x47.

To use an PC8574 as input we have to write a 0xFF to it (to prevent the open drain outputs pulling the pin low). 
Then the pin state can be acquired with a 1 byte read transaction over I2C.

Reading an output switch will readback its logical value. So all I2C extenders (no matter if used as in- or output) can be read in bulk. I2C is fast enough to read all 32 of them (on 4 channels in parallel) with 625 Hz repetition rate. Reading an empty address will give a NO_ACK read error, which will be silently ignored.

Writing a 0 to an input switch will pull the pin low and hence always readback 0. So this should be avoided. The user must take care to not send `OUT` commands with a hwIndex addressing an input!

# The taskDebouncer()

 It is a debounce routine running with 333 Hz, reading all switches (matrix and I2C) into an array
 * Switch Matrix (SM) is read in foreground
 * I2C transactions happen in background (TI I2C driver), query all port extenders (in parallel to reading the SM)
 * When both reads are finished, continue to Debouncing routine
 * look at t-n history of switch state: (n is stored for each switch in a 2 bit vertical counter)
 * if counter overflows: no change for 4 read cycles = definite change. Store new bit state and bits which changed.
 * The serial reporter function looks for changeg bits, encodes them and reports them on the serial port
 * The quick-fire rule function checks a list of rules, which can be triggered by changed bits, which can lead to immediate actions, like coils firing.

# A `hwIndex` identifies an input / output port
We use a 16 bit number to identify each input / output pin. 

         Switch input hwIndex addresses:
        ---------------------------------
         0 - 63  --> Switch matrix on mainboard
         64 - 71 --> Solenoid driver on mainboard     (not an input!)
         72 - 79 --> I2Cch. 0, I2Cadr. 0x41, bit 0-7  (First  external PCL GPIO extender on channel 0)
         80 - 87 --> I2Cch. 0, I2Cadr. 0x42, bit 0-7  (Second external PCL GPIO extender on channel 0)
         312-319 --> I2Cch. 3, I2Cadr. 0x47, bit 0-7  (7th    external PCL GPIO extender on channel 3)

### Calculating the hwIndex for the Switch matrix
        hwIndex = SMrow * 8 + SMcol
where SMrow is the row wire number (from 0-7) and SMcol is the column wire number (from 0-7).

### Calculating the hwIndex for I2C inputs
        hwIndex = 64 + I2Cchannel * 64 + ( I2Cadr - 64 ) * 8 + PinIndex
 where I2Cchannel is the output channel on the mainboard (from 0-3), I2Cadr is the configured I2C address
 set by dip switches on the port extender (0x40 - 0x47) and PinIndex is the output pin (0-7).
 
 Output extension boards (solenoid driver / digital outputs / etc.) also use the PCF I2C chip and hence the same
 addresses. The chip knows it is an output one it receives a I2C `write` command. So outputs do not need to be
 configured, just fire the OUT command with the known output address.
 
 Note that hwIndex 0 - 63 is not a valid output address as it refers to the Switch matrix which can never be an output.
 That beeing said, I might map hwIndex 60 - 63 to the internal hardware PWM outputs on the mainboard, which do not
 use the PCF GPIO extenders. To be seen.

# Serial command API

        Available commands
        ------------------
        ?     : Display list of commands
        *IDN? : Display ID and version info
        SW?   : Return the state of ALL switches (40 bytes)
        OUT   : OUT hwIndex tPulse PWMhigh PWMlow
        OUT   : OUT hwIndex PWMvalue
        RUL   : RUL ID IDin IDout trHoldOff tPulse pwmOn pwmOff

        RULD  : Disable a previously defined rule:  RULD ID
        LED   : LED <CH>,<led0>,<led1> ...


## `SW?` command returns the state of all Switch inputs
Returns 40 bytes as 8 digit hex numbers. This encodes all 320 bits which can be addressed by a hwIndex.
### Example
Sent:

    SW?
Received:

    SW:00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

## `OUT` command Set a solenoid driver output
 * hwIndex 
 * pulse time [ms] (0 - 32767), optional
 * pwm pulse power (0-15), optional
 * pwm hold power  (0-15)
 
### Example
Set output pin with hwIndex 0x100 to a pwm power level of 10 and keep it there.

    OUT 0x100 10

Pulse output with hwIndex 0x110 for 300 ms with a pwm power level of 10 and then keep it at a power level of 2.

    OUT 0x110 300 10 2

 
## `RUL` command setup a quick-fire rule
 * quickRuleId (0-64)
 * input switch ID number
 * driver output ID number
 * post trigger hold-off time [ms]
 * pulse duration [ms]
 * pulse pwm (0-15)
 * hold pwm  (0-15)
 * Enable trigger on pos edge?
 * Enable auto. output off once input releases
 * Enable level Trigger (no edge check)

### Notes
When enabling level trigger, the edge detecion is disabled and the rule will stay in triggered state
as long as the input is high (or low)
 
When auto. output off is enabled, the rule stays in triggered state as long as the level is high. When the level is low again, it disables the outputs and arms the trigger again.

Warning: When auto. output off is disabled and level trigger is enabled it leads to a periodic trigger condition. Sending trigger events every `triggerHoldOffTime` as long as the level is there (not so good)

### Example
    RUL 0 0x23 0x100 4 1 15 3 1 1 0
    
Setup ruleId 0. Input hwIndex is 0x23, output hwIndex is 0x100. After triggering, at least 4 ms need to ellapse before the trigger becomes armed again. Once triggered it pulses the output for 1 ms with pwmPower 15, then it holds the output with pwmPower 3. The trigger happens on a positive edge. Once the input is released (and at least 4 ms ellapsed), the output is switched off again.

## `LED` command controls WS2811 RGB LED strings
Raw data values are attached to serial command and just sent on one of the channels over the SPI hardware

## `I2C` command does a custom I2C transaction
Not yet implemented. There will be commands to do send / receive of custom bytes to custom addresses. Mutex of I2C hardware!
